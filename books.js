			body: "Dickens was one of the best character writers in literary history. Oliver Twist is another example of his palpable skill. With standouts like Fagin, the artful dodger, Charlie Bates, Mr. Bumble, Bill Sikes and Oliver Twist himself Dickens weaves a story of lost inheritance at the hands of London's criminal network. there is a mystery here that the great dickens leave to the end. Of course, with Dickens he takes a while getting there using his patented florid descriptive language. You have to be ok with descriptive dialogue to enjoy his work. I shudder to think of his longer works like Bleak House or Nicholas Nickleby since even in this and Great expectations Dickens can meander into side stories for many chapters. You probably know a little of Oliver's story but do you know his family history if not read this and let the master storyteller enthrall you.",

		plot: "The story of Oliver Twist - orphaned, and set upon by evil and adversity from his first breath - shocked readers when it was published. After running away from the workhouse and pompous beadle Mr Bumble, Oliver finds himself lured into a den of thieves peopled by vivid and memorable characters - the Artful Dodger, vicious burglar Bill Sikes, his dog Bull's Eye, and prostitute Nancy, all watched over by cunning master-thief Fagin. Combining elements of Gothic Romance, the Newgate Novel and popular melodrama, Dickens created an entirely new kind of fiction, scathing in its indictment of a cruel society, and pervaded by an unforgettable sense of threat and mystery.",

			body: '"Dombey and Son" is not Charles Dickens\'s best-known novel, far from it. However, its thousand pages contain a lovely family and social fiction that his contemporary Victor Hugo will doubtless not have disdained. All the ingredients make a Dickensian novel an extraordinary universe of shattered destinies and colorful figures.\nA novel of vanity and ambition, "Dombey & Son" denounces the greed of the heart, the pretension of class, the manipulation of beings, and the harshness of a society that does not spare those in need. With unique humor, Charles Dickens deploys this talent that belongs only to him to give life to a massive gallery of characters to eat in both senses.\nI don\'t know of any other period author capable of featuring many leading and supporting characters, nimbly interlocking them with each other, and giving them a personality of their own, endearing or repulsive. Likewise, each actor in this beautiful drama searched and worked in-depth until he offered the reader the best of his qualities or faults. The result is such a closeness to the ordinary heroes and heroines of the novel that we, the readers, feel ourselves becoming one of them.',
